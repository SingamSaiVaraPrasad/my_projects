# FrozenLake-v1 Environment Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of the FrozenLake-v1 environment from the OpenAI Gym library. In this project, an agent is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach, incorporating both a policy network and a target network. 

After training, the agent navigates through the frozen ice grid to determine the optimized path to the goal.
